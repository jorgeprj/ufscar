## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create a C program to calculate and inform the client about the price of a land plot based on its dimensions and the price per square meter in that region.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the dimensions (length and width) of the land plot from the user.
2. Read the price per square meter in that region.
3. Calculate the total price of the land plot by multiplying the area (length * width) by the price per square meter.
4. Display the total price to the client.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following information:

- Length of the land plot: 10 meters
- Width of the land plot: 10 meters
- Price per square meter in that region: R$ 202.00

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Length of the land plot: 10 meters
Width of the land plot: 10 meters
Price per square meter: R$ 202.00
Total Price: R$ 20,200.00
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the client about the total price of the land plot.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the total price based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
