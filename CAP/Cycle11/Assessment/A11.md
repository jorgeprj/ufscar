## Question 1 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

double mat[3][2]={
{1.6,2.5},
{3.4,4.3},
{5.2,6.1}
};

```

## Question 2 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void transpo(int linhas, int colunas, int mat){
    int *i, *j, aux;
  
    for (i = 0; i < linhas; i++) {
        for (j = i+1; j < colunas; j++) {
            if (j != i) {
                aux = mat[i][j];
                mat[i][j] = mat[j][i];
                mat[j][i] = aux;
            }
        }
  } 
}

```

## Question 3 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define TAMANHO 50

double media(int mat[][TAMANHO], int linhas, int colunas){
    double soma = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < linhas; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < colunas; j++){
            soma += (double)mat[i][j];
    }
    
    return soma/(linhas * colunas);
}
```
