## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program that defines a function to find and return the smallest number among two input numbers.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Implement a function called `findSmallest` that receives two numbers as arguments (num1 and num2).
2. Within the function, compare the two numbers to determine which one is the smallest.
3. Return the smallest number as the result of the function.

Ensure that the `findSmallest` function correctly identifies and returns the smallest number among the provided inputs.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following values:

- Number 1: 7.0
- Number 2: 5.5

The algorithm should calculate and return:

```
Smallest Number: 5.5
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the smallest number among the provided values.

Now, you can implement the program with the `findSmallest` function to find and return the smallest number.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
