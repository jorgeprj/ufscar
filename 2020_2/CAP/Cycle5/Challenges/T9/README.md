![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-DA1F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C program that reads three measurements and determines if these measurements can form a triangle. If the measurements do not form a triangle, the program should display a message informing the user. If the measurements form a triangle, the program should classify it into one of the three categories: equilateral (all sides equal), isosceles (two sides equal), or scalene (all sides different).

The rules for determining if three measurements can form a triangle are as follows:
- Each side of the triangle must be smaller than the sum of the other two sides.

The program should receive the measurements from the user and perform the necessary checks to classify the triangle.

Now, you can implement the program based on the information provided above. Make sure to check if the measurements form a triangle according to the mentioned rules and classify it correctly.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
