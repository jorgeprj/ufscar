# Object-Oriented Programming (POO)

Repository created to store all code projects and works created during graduation. Unfortunately some projects were lost.

## Subject Description
Unfortunately, the content created for the subject taught by Professor [Renato Bueno](https://site.dc.ufscar.br/docente/5cefc9b548365a001679f76c) during the graduation period was lost.

So, the material contained here will be from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-javascript-moderno-do-basico-ao-avancado/) and [Curso em Vídeo course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dkqe2aR0tQK74m8SFe-aGsY). The projects are very similar. However, the language changes.

## Contents
This material was divided into some parts:

### First concepts

* **What's an object ?** First concepts.
  
    [Class Diagram](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen.drawio) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen.ts) 

* **Visibility** `Public`, `Private` and `Protected`.
  
    [Class Diagram](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen2.drawio) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen2.ts) 

* **Start of encapsulation** It is one of the elements that add security to the application in object-oriented programming by hiding the properties, creating a kind of black box. Most object-oriented languages ​​implement encapsulation based on private properties, linked to special methods called `getters` and `setters`, which will return and set the property's value, respectively.
  
    [Class Diagram](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen3.drawio) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Pen/Pen3.ts) 

* **First test** Create an object called Account Bank that makes it possible to open the account, close the account, deposit value to the balance, withdraw values ​​from the balance and pay the bank fee. Create the code and class diagram.
   
    OBS: Create at least one public, protected and private attribute.

    Specifications:
    - To open an account it is necessary to define the type of account: checking or savings.
    - New checking accounts start with a $50 in balance.
    - New savings accounts stat with $150 in balance.
    - It is only possible to close the account if the balance is equal to zero.
    - The monthly fee for the checking account will be $12
    - The monthly fee for the savings account will be $20

### Encapsulation

* **Interfaces** List of services provided by a component. It is the contact with the outside world that defines what can be done with an object of this class.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Inheritance.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)


* **Inheritance**: Consists in inheriting characteristics of all objects above it, its “ancestors”. Inheritance from the characteristics of the object above is considered direct inheritance, while the others are considered indirect inheritance.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Inheritance.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)

* **Polymorphism**: Consists of changing the inner workings of a method inherited from a parent object.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Polymorphism.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)
