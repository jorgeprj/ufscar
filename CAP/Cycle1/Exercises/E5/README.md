## Problem Description

In this exercise, you should create an algorithm in VisuAlg that reads three grades of a student and calculates their weighted average (the grades have respective weights of 1, 2, and 3). You can research how to calculate a weighted average.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the first grade of the student.
2. Read the second grade of the student.
3. Read the third grade of the student.
4. Calculate the weighted average of the three grades using the following formula:

   Weighted Average = (Grade 1 * Weight 1 + Grade 2 * Weight 2 + Grade 3 * Weight 3) / (Weight 1 + Weight 2 + Weight 3)

   - Weight 1: 1
   - Weight 2: 2
   - Weight 3: 3

5. Display the result, informing the student's weighted average.

## Example

Suppose the student's grades are as follows:

- Grade 1: 7.5
- Grade 2: 8.0
- Grade 3: 6.5

The algorithm should calculate the weighted average as follows:

```
Grade 1: 7.5
Grade 2: 8.0
Grade 3: 6.5
Weighted Average: 7.17
```

Therefore, the student's weighted average is 7.17.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the provided information and follow the requested format. Make sure to read the three grades of the student, calculate the weighted average, and display the result.
