## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to list all the divisors of a number N entered by the user.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read a positive integer N from the user.
2. Determine and list all the divisors of the number N.
3. Display the result, showing the list of divisors.

## Example

Suppose the user enters the number N as 12.

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Number N: 12
Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
```

Therefore, the algorithm lists all the divisors of the number 12.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the provided information and follow the desired format.
