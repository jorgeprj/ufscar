## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will write a complete C program to read an array of 10 elements, all of type `unsigned int`. The program should also present the data of the array in a single line in reverse order compared to the input.

To achieve this, you should iterate through the array from the end to the beginning, decreasing the index value. The elements should be separated by a space, and the line should be terminated with a newline character ('\n').

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following input values for the array:

```
Input: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```

The program should calculate and display the reversed array:

```
Output: 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10
```

Therefore, the algorithm reads the input array, reverses its order, and presents the reversed array as output.

Now, you can implement the program to achieve this functionality based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
