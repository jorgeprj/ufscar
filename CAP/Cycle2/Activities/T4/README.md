## Problem Description

Write an algorithm that reads three measurements that are supposed to represent the sides of a triangle. The algorithm should first check if the measurements can form a triangle. If they cannot, a message should be provided to the user. If they can form a triangle, the algorithm should classify it into one of the following categories:

- Equilateral: All sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal, and the third side is different.
- Scalene: All sides are different.

**Tip**: To form a triangle, each side must be shorter than the sum of the other two sides.
