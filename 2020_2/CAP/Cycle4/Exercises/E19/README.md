## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create a C program to calculate and print the weighted average of three grades obtained by a student. The grades have respective weights of 1, 2, and 3.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the first grade from the user.
2. Read the second grade from the user.
3. Read the third grade from the user.
4. Calculate the weighted average using the following formula:

   Weighted Average = (Grade1 * Weight1 + Grade2 * Weight2 + Grade3 * Weight3) / (Weight1 + Weight2 + Weight3)

   Where:
   - Grade1, Grade2, and Grade3 are the grades entered by the user.
   - Weight1, Weight2, and Weight3 are the respective weights (1, 2, and 3).

5. Display the calculated weighted average to the user.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following grades:

- First Grade: 7.5
- Second Grade: 8.0
- Third Grade: 6.5

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
First Grade: 7.5
Second Grade: 8.0
Third Grade: 6.5
Weighted Average: 7.33
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the calculated weighted average of the three grades.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the weighted average based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
