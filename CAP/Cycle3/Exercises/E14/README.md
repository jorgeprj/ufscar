## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to display the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the initial elements 1 and 1, and from the third element onwards, it is generated using the expression: element_n = element_(n-1) + element_(n-2).

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the number of elements, n, to be displayed from the user.
2. Implement a loop or logic to calculate and display the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Display the list of elements.

## Example

Suppose the user wants to display the first 8 elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Number of Elements (n): 8
Fibonacci Sequence:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
```

Therefore, the algorithm displays the first 8 elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to calculate and display the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence based on the provided information.
