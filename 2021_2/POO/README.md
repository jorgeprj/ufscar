# Object-Oriented Programming (POO)

Repository created to store all code projects and works created during graduation. Unfortunately some projects were lost.

## Subject Description
Unfortunately, the content created for the subject taught by Professor [Renato Bueno](https://site.dc.ufscar.br/docente/5cefc9b548365a001679f76c) during the graduation period was lost.

So, the material contained here will be from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-javascript-moderno-do-basico-ao-avancado/). The projects are very similar. However, the language changes.

### Language

## Contents
The course was divided into 5 topics:

* **UML**: class diagram 

* **Abstraction**: Consists of one of the most important points within any Object Oriented language.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Abstraction.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)

* **Encapsulation**: It is one of the elements that add security to the application in object-oriented programming by hiding the properties, creating a kind of black box. Most object-oriented languages ​​implement encapsulation based on private properties, linked to special methods called `getters` and `setters`, which will return and set the property's value, respectively.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Encapsulation.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)

* **Inheritance**: Consists in inheriting characteristics of all objects above it, its “ancestors”. Inheritance from the characteristics of the object above is considered direct inheritance, while the others are considered indirect inheritance.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Inheritance.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)

* **Polymorphism**: Consists of changing the inner workings of a method inherited from a parent object.
  
    [Example](/2021_2/POO/Polymorphism.ts) | [Practice](/2021_2/POO/Practice.ts)
