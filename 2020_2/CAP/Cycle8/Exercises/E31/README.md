## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a procedure in C that receives an Arabic numeral between 1 and 50 and prints the corresponding Roman numeral. The procedure should be capable of generating and printing the Roman numeral without the need to return the Roman numeral to the main program.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Implement a procedure called `arabicToRoman` that takes an Arabic numeral as input.
2. Inside the procedure, convert the Arabic numeral into its corresponding Roman numeral based on the Roman numeral rules.
3. Print the generated Roman numeral.

Ensure that the `arabicToRoman` procedure correctly converts Arabic numerals into Roman numerals within the specified range.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following value as input:

- Arabic Numeral: 21

The algorithm should calculate and print:

```
Roman Numeral: XXI
```

Therefore, the algorithm correctly converts the Arabic numeral 21 into the Roman numeral XXI.

Now, you can implement the program with the `arabicToRoman` procedure to convert Arabic numerals to Roman numerals.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
