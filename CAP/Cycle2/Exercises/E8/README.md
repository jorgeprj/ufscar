## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to calculate a person's ideal weight based on their height and gender. The algorithm should use the following formulas:

- For men: Ideal Weight = (72.7 * height) - 58
- For women: Ideal Weight = (62.1 * height) - 44.7

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the person's height in meters.
2. Read the person's gender (male or female).
3. Calculate the ideal weight based on the provided formula corresponding to the person's gender.
4. Display the result, informing the person's ideal weight.

## Example

Suppose the person's height is 1.80 meters, and they are male.

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Height: 1.80 m
Gender: Male
Ideal Weight: 72.86 kg
```

Therefore, the person's ideal weight is calculated to be 72.86 kilograms based on the provided height and gender.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to calculate the ideal weight of a person based on their height and gender.
