## Problem Description

A computer science student decided to apply their knowledge of algorithms to make a vestibular problem solution more generic. The problem they encountered is as follows: From point A, a surveyor sees the top T of a hill at an angle of 45 degrees. After walking exactly 50 meters towards the hill, they started seeing the top T at an angle of 60 degrees. Determine the height of the hill.

## Task

Propose a generic algorithm that allows calculating the height of the hill based on the following information provided by the user:

- The number of meters walked towards the hill.
- The initial viewing angle.
- The viewing angle after walking.
