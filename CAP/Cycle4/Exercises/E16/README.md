## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create a C program to calculate how many horseshoes are needed to replace all the horseshoes of the horses in a horse farm (haras).

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the number of horses in the horse farm from the user.
2. Calculate the total number of horseshoes needed, considering that each horse needs four horseshoes.
3. Display the total number of horseshoes needed to the user.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following information:

- Number of horses in the horse farm: 15

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Number of Horses: 15
Total Number of Horseshoes Needed: 60
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the total number of horseshoes needed to replace all the horseshoes for the horses in the farm.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the total number of horseshoes needed based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
