## Problem Description

In this exercise, you should create an algorithm in VisuAlg that helps a driver calculate how many liters of gasoline they can fill their tank with a given payment amount, based on the price per liter of gasoline.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the price per liter of gasoline.
2. Read the payment amount the driver wants to spend on gasoline.
3. Calculate the quantity of liters the driver can buy by dividing the payment amount by the price per liter of gasoline.
4. Display the result, indicating how many liters of gasoline can be put in the tank.

## Example

If the price per liter of gasoline is R$ 5.00 and the driver wants to spend R$ 50.00, the algorithm should calculate:

```
Price per Liter of Gasoline: R$ 5.00
Payment Amount: R$ 50.00
Quantity of Liters: 10 liters
```

Therefore, the driver can buy 10 liters of gasoline with the specified payment amount.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the information provided above and follow the requested format. Make sure to read the price per liter of gasoline, calculate the quantity of liters the driver can buy, and display the result.
