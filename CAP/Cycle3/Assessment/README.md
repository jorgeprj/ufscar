## Question 1

You are organizing a party and want to calculate the total number of handshakes that will occur among the guests. Additionally, you want to list all possible combinations of handshakes that can occur during the party.

**Input:**
- Prompt the user to enter the number of party guests (convidados1).

**Output:**
- Calculate the total number of handshakes and display it in the format: "The total number of handshakes is: total".
- List all possible handshake combinations in the format: "Guest X - Guest Y," where X and Y represent the guest numbers shaking hands.
- Ensure not to repeat handshake combinations and avoid a guest shaking hands with themselves.

**Example Execution:**

Enter the number of party guests: 4

The total number of handshakes is: 6

Possible handshake combinations:
Guest 1 - Guest 2
Guest 1 - Guest 3
Guest 1 - Guest 4
Guest 2 - Guest 3
Guest 2 - Guest 4
Guest 3 - Guest 4
```

**Instructions:**
- Present the result clearly to the user.
