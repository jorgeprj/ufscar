## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create a C program to calculate and print the arithmetic mean (average) of three grades obtained by a student in a subject.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the first grade from the user.
2. Read the second grade from the user.
3. Read the third grade from the user.
4. Calculate the arithmetic mean by adding the three grades and dividing the sum by 3.
5. Display the calculated arithmetic mean to the user.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following grades:

- First Grade: 7.5
- Second Grade: 8.0
- Third Grade: 6.5

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
First Grade: 7.5
Second Grade: 8.0
Third Grade: 6.5
Arithmetic Mean: 7.33
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the calculated arithmetic mean of the three grades.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the arithmetic mean based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
