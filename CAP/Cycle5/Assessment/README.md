# CAP Assessment - Cycle 5

**General Instructions:**
- The assessment consists of 3 questions.
- Use the specified programming language for each question.
- Follow best programming practices, such as naming variables clearly and providing readable output messages.
- You may use calculators or programming IDEs as needed.

## Question 1

Create a program that checks if three real values form a triangle. If any value is null or negative, it's certain they do not form a triangle. Additionally, you should consider the following rule for any of the sides: the sum of the other two sides cannot be less than or equal to the side being examined.

### Input
The program should receive three real values, one per line.

### Output
The program should print a single word in English:
- `YES` if the values form a triangle.
- `NO` if the values do not form a triangle.


## Question 2

## Question 2

### Description
Write a C program that reads three distinct integer values and arranges them in ascending order. For example:

Input:
```
3
5
2
```

Output:
```
2
3
5
```

The values should be printed, one per line. Please note that the program will be automatically graded, so do not include any messages in the input or output.

## Question 3

A triangle can be classified as right-angled, acute-angled, or obtuse-angled based on its internal angles. A right-angled triangle has one angle measuring 90 degrees. An acute-angled triangle has all angles less than 90 degrees, and an obtuse-angled triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees.

You should create a program that reads the measures of the internal angles of a triangle and determines whether it is a **RIGHT**, **ACUTE**, or **OBTUSE** triangle. If the angles do not sum up to 180 degrees, an error message should be displayed, which is simply the word ***"ERROR."***

The input angles should be between 0 and 180 degrees, and both input and output should contain no additional information.

**Example:**
```
90
45
45
RIGHT
```

### Input
The program should read the measures of three internal angles, one per line.

### Output
The program should print one of the following words:
- `RIGHT` if the triangle is right-angled.
- `ACUTE` if the triangle is acute-angled.
- `OBTUSE` if the triangle is obtuse-angled.
- `ERROR` if the sum of the angles is not 180 degrees.


## General Notes
- Be sure to carefully follow the instructions for each question.
- Provide clear messages to the user and present results legibly.
- Use the programming language specified in each question.
