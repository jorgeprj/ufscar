## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program to determine the day of the week based on the provided information of day, month, and year. This program can help you find out the day of the week for today, your birthdate, or any specific date.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the day, month, and year from the user as input.
2. Calculate the day of the week using an appropriate algorithm or method.
3. Display the calculated day of the week to the user.

You can implement a commonly used algorithm or search for existing C libraries or functions that calculate the day of the week based on the date provided.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following date:

- Day: 15
- Month: 9
- Year: 2023

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Day: 15
Month: 9
Year: 2023
Day of the Week: Thursday
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the day of the week corresponding to the provided date.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the day of the week based on the provided date information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
