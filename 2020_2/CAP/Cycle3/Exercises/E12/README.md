## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to inform the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 8 within the range from 10 to 320.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Implement a loop or logic to find and display the numbers that are multiples of either 3 or 8 within the range from 10 to 320.
2. Display the list of numbers that meet the criteria.

## Example

The algorithm should calculate and display the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 8 within the specified range, for example:

```
Multiples of 3 or 8 between 10 and 320: 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 51, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 72, 75, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 99, 102, 104, 108, 112, 114, 120, 123, 126, 128, 132, 136, 138, 144, 147, 150, 152, 156, 160, 162, 168, 171, 174, 176, 180, 184, 186, 192, 195, 198, 200, 204, 208, 210, 216, 219, 222, 224, 228, 232, 234, 240, 243, 246, 248, 252, 256, 258, 264, 267, 270, 272, 276, 280, 282, 288, 291, 294, 296, 300, 304, 306, 312, 315, 318
```

Therefore, the algorithm lists the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 8 within the specified range.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to find and display these numbers based on the provided information.
