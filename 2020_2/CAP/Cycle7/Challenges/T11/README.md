## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C program that reads a positive integer (N) and then calls a function written by you to calculate and return the root (R) of that number with an error less than 0.01, using the Newton's Method.

The Newton's Method is a technique for finding approximations to the roots of numerical equations. You have already developed the algorithm for this method in the previous cycle. Now, you should encapsulate this algorithm into a function that can be called by the main program.

The program should compare the result obtained by the function you wrote with the result obtained by the pre-defined mathematical function in the language (e.g., the `sqrt()` function to calculate the square root).

Now, you can implement the program based on the information provided above. Make sure the program reads the positive integer, calls the Newton's Method function to calculate the root, and compares the result with the pre-defined mathematical function. Also, ensure that the Newton's Method function is capable of calculating the root with an error less than 0.01.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
