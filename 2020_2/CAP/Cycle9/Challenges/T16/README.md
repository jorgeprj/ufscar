## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a function in the C programming language that receives two points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) on the Cartesian plane and returns the general equation of a line passing through these two points.

The general equation of a line is given by:

```
Line = (Ay - By) * x + (Bx - Ax) * y + (Ax * By - Bx * Ay) = 0
```

The function should receive points A and B as parameters and calculate the equation of the line based on these coordinates.

Now, you can implement the function based on the information provided above. Make sure the function correctly calculates the equation of the line passing through the two given points.

## Programming Language

The function should be implemented in the C programming language.
