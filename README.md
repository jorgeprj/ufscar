## [Algorithm Construction and Programming (CAP)](CAP/README.md)

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-DA1F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)

*Algorithm Construction and Programming* was the first programming subject taught. It started with algorithms, using VisuAlg, and C was chosen as the first language.
