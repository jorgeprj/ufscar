## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C program that reads three measurements and determines if these measurements can form a triangle. If the measurements do not form a triangle, the program should display a message informing the user. If they form a triangle, the program should classify it into one of the following categories:

- Equilateral Triangle: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles Triangle: Two sides are equal, and one side is different.
- Scalene Triangle: All three sides are different.

To form a triangle, the following condition must be met: Each side of the triangle must be smaller than the sum of the other two sides.

The program should allow the user to input the three measurements and then perform the necessary checks to determine the classification of the triangle or inform that it's not possible to form a triangle.

Now, you can implement the program based on the information provided above. Make sure the program performs the correct checks and provides the appropriate classification for the triangle, if possible.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
