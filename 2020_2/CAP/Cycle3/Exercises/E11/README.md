## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to display the first 40 prime numbers.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Implement a loop or logic to find and display the first 40 prime numbers.
2. Display the list of the first 40 prime numbers.

## Example

The algorithm should calculate and display the first 40 prime numbers, for example:

```
First 40 Prime Numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179
```

Therefore, the algorithm lists the first 40 prime numbers.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to find and display the first 40 prime numbers based on the provided information.
