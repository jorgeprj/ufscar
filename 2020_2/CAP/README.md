# Algorithm Construction and Programming (CAP)

Repository created to store all code projects and works created during graduation. Unfortunately some projects were lost.

## Subject Description

Algorithm Construction and Programming was the first programming subject taught. It started with algorithms, using VisuAlg, and C was chosen as the first language.

## Contents
The division of all the content was done in cycles, each cycle had a test, challenges and exercises for practice. The course was divided into 5 topics:

### Algorithms
* Cycle 1

    Getting to know [VisualAlg](https://visualg3.com.br), first concepts and algorithms

    [Exercises](Exercises/Cycle%201/) | [Challenges](Challenges/Cycle%201/) | [Tests](Tests/Cycle%201/)
* Cycle 2
    
    Conditional structures and logical expressions

    [Exercises](Exercises/Cycle%202/) | [Challenges](Challenges/Cycle%202/) | [Tests](Tests/Cycle%202/)
* Cycle 3

    Looping structures

    [Exercises](Exercises/Cycle%203/) | [Challenges](Challenges/Cycle%203/) | [Tests](Tests/Cycle%203/)
