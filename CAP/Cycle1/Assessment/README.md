**General Instructions:**
- The assessment consists of 4 questions.
- Use the programming language specified in each question.
- Follow best programming practices, such as naming variables clearly and providing readable output messages.
- You may use calculators or programming IDEs as needed.

## Question 1

Many people buy dollars to protect themselves from the devaluation of the Brazilian Real. Currently, the dollar is quoted at R$ 5.67 (exchange rate as of 03/04/2021 at 5:18 PM). In other words, $1.00 buys R$ 5.67, or conversely, R$ 5.67 is needed to buy $1.00. Create an algorithm in VisuAlg that obtains from the user the amount of Brazilian Reais available for the purchase of dollars and informs the total dollars that can be purchased with that amount of Reais.

## Question 2

Suppose you want to create an algorithm to calculate the area of a trapezoid, and you found notes in your school notebooks with the information shown in the figure. Based on these notes and the knowledge acquired in the Algorithm Construction and Programming course, create an algorithm to calculate the area of a trapezoid.

**Instructions:**
- The algorithm should prompt the user to provide the values of the larger and smaller bases of the trapezoid, as well as the height.
- The calculation of the trapezoid's area is given by the formula: `Area = ((larger_base + smaller_base) * height) / 2`
- Present the result clearly to the user.

## Question 3

Analyze the code below and choose the corresponding values of A, B, and C.

```plaintext
// Variable Declarations
Var
    A, B, C: real

// Commands, procedures, functions, operators, etc...
Begin
    A <- B + C
    B <- 25
    C <- 13
    A <- B - A
    C <- C + A
    B <- 30 - C + B
    Write("A =", A)
    Write("B =", B)
    Write("C =", C)
End
```

## Question 4

Suppose you have the following problem: create an algorithm to calculate the distance between two points, A and B. Also, suppose you looked for your math notebook and found the drawing shown in the figure with a formula. Assuming that the functions `sqrt(A)` calculate the square root of value A and `power(B, Pot)` calculate B raised to the power Pot, solve the problem of creating the algorithm to calculate the distance between two points A and B.

**Instructions:**
- The algorithm should prompt the user to provide the coordinates of points A and B on the Cartesian plane (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
- Use the following formula to calculate the distance between the two points: `Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1) power 2 + (y2 - y1) power 2)`
- Present the result clearly to the user.

## General Notes
- Be sure to carefully follow the instructions for each question.
- Provide clear messages to the user and present results legibly.
- Use the programming language specified in each question.
