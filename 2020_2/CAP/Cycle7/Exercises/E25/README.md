## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program that uses a function to determine whether a given number is prime or not.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read an integer value N from the user as input.
2. Implement a function called `isPrime` that receives the integer N as an argument and checks whether it is a prime number.
3. The `isPrime` function should return a boolean value indicating whether the number is prime (true) or not prime (false).
4. Display a message to inform the user whether the provided number is prime or not based on the result from the `isPrime` function.

Ensure that the `isPrime` function correctly determines whether the provided number is prime or not.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following value:

- N: 17

The algorithm should check and display:

```
Number 17 is prime.
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user that the provided number is prime.

Now, you can implement the program with the `isPrime` function to check and display whether a number is prime or not.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
