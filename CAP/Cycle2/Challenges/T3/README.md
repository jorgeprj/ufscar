## Problem Description

A computer science student was challenged to produce an algorithmic solution to assign a grade to a student in a subject based on the final grade the student obtained. Grades A, B, C, or D should be assigned according to the provided table.

## Grades - Concepts Table

- If MF ≥ 9, the grade should be A.
- If 7 ≤ MF < 9, the grade should be B.
- If 6 ≤ MF < 7, the grade should be C.
- If MF < 6, the grade should be D.

## Algorithm Issue

The student produced an algorithm but noticed that it was giving incorrect answers for final grades above 7. They want to understand the reason for this issue and obtain alternative versions to correct the algorithm.

### Questions

A) Explain the reason why the algorithm was getting confused when the final grades were above 7.

B) Provide at least two alternative versions to correct the algorithm.
