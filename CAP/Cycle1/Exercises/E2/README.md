## Problem Description

In this exercise, you should create an algorithm in VisuAlg that calculates how many horseshoes are needed to replace all the horseshoes for the horses in a horse farm.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the total number of horses on the horse farm.
2. Calculate the number of horseshoes needed by multiplying the total number of horses by 4 (since each horse has 4 horseshoes).
3. Display the result, indicating how many horseshoes are needed.

## Example

If there are 10 horses on the horse farm, the algorithm should calculate:

```
Total Number of Horses: 10
Number of Horseshoes Needed: 40
```

Therefore, 40 horseshoes will be needed to replace all the horseshoes for the horses.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the information provided above and follow the requested format. Make sure to read the total number of horses, calculate the number of horseshoes needed, and display the result.
