## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C procedure that calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of an integer A by another integer B.

The procedure should take as input the integers A and B and calculate the quotient (the result of integer division) and the remainder (the value left after division) of this division.

Now, you can implement the procedure based on the information provided above. Make sure the procedure calculates the quotient and remainder correctly and returns or displays these values.

## Programming Language

The procedure should be implemented in the C programming language.
