## Problem Description

A computer science student decided to apply their knowledge of algorithms to make a vestibular problem solution more generic. The problem they encountered is as follows: An airplane takes off from an airport in the Netherlands, following a straight-line path, forming a 30-degree angle with the ground. For those unfamiliar with the Netherlands, the terrain is incredibly flat. After traveling 1,000 meters, what is the altitude reached by the airplane?

## Task

Propose a generic algorithm that allows calculating the altitude reached by the airplane based on the following information provided by the user:

- The number of meters traveled by the airplane.
- The takeoff angle.
