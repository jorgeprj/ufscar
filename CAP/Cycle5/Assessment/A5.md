float m1,m2,m3;
int main()

{
     scanf("\n%f",&m1);
     scanf("\n%f",&m2);
     scanf("\n%f",&m3);
     if ((m1<(m2+m3))&&(m2<(m1+m3))&&(m3<(m1+m2)))
          printf("YES");
     else
          printf("NO");
          
     return 0;
}
```

## Question 2 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int n1, n2, n3;       
  
  scanf("%d",&n1);
  scanf("%d",&n2);
  scanf("%d",&n3);
  
  if (n1 <= n2 && n2 <= n3){
    printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n1, n2, n3);
  }
  else 
    if (n1 <= n3 && n3 <= n2){
      printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n1, n3, n2);
    }
    else 
      if (n2 <= n1 && n1 <= n3){
        printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n2, n1, n3);
      }
      else 
      if (n2 <= n3 && n3 <= n1){
        printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n2, n3, n1);
      }
      else 
        if (n3 <= n1 && n1 <= n2) {
          printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n3, n1, n2);
        }
        else{
          printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", n3, n2, n1);
        }

  return 0;
}
```

## Question 3 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

float a1,a2,a3;
int main()

{
     scanf("\n%f",&a1);
     scanf("\n%f",&a2);
     scanf("\n%f",&a3);
     if (a1+a2+a3!=180){
          printf("ERRO");
     }
     else 
          if ((a1==90)||(a2==90)||(a3==90)){
               printf("RETANGULO");
          }
          else 
               if ((a1>90)||(a2>90)||(a3>90)){
                    printf("OBTUSANGULO");
               }
               else 
                    printf("ACUTANGULO");
