## Problem Description

In this exercise, you need to write a complete C program to read an array of 10 elements, all with the unsigned int base type.

The program should also present the data of the array in a single line, in the order of entry. The elements should be separated by a space, and the line should be terminated with '\n' (newline character).

## Example

Here's an example of how the program should work:

Input:
```
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```

Output:
```
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```

The program should read the input values, store them in an array, and then display the same values in the same order.

Now, you can implement the program as described to read and display an array of unsigned int values.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
