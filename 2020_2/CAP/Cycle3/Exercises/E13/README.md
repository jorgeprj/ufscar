## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to display the first n elements of an Arithmetic Progression (AP) given its first element and the common difference. The number of elements, n, will also be provided by the user.

An AP can be either increasing or decreasing.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the first element of the AP.
2. Read the common difference of the AP.
3. Read the number of elements, n, to be displayed.
4. Implement a loop or logic to calculate and display the first n elements of the AP.
5. Display the list of elements.

## Example

Suppose the first element of the AP is 3, the common difference is 2, and the user wants to display the first 5 elements of the AP.

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
First Element: 3
Common Difference: 2
Number of Elements (n): 5
Elements of the Arithmetic Progression:
3, 5, 7, 9, 11
```

Therefore, the algorithm displays the first 5 elements of the AP.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to calculate and display the first n elements of an AP based on the provided information.
