## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create a C program to calculate the amount of gasoline (in liters) that a driver can fill in their tank with a given amount of money.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the price per liter of gasoline from the user.
2. Read the amount of money the driver has for refueling.
3. Calculate the number of liters of gasoline that can be filled with the given amount of money.
4. Display the number of liters that can be filled to the user.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following information:

- Price per liter of gasoline: R$ 5.80
- Amount of money for refueling: R$ 100.00

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Price per Liter of Gasoline: R$ 5.80
Amount of Money for Refueling: R$ 100.00
Liters of Gasoline Filled: 17.24
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the number of liters of gasoline that can be filled with the given amount of money.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the number of liters based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
