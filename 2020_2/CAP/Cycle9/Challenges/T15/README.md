## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a function in the C programming language that receives as parameters two points in the Cartesian plane, represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and returns the midpoint between these two points.

The midpoint between two points is calculated by taking the average of the x and y coordinates separately. Therefore, the midpoint (xm, ym) between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:

```c
xm = (x1 + x2) / 2
ym = (y1 + y2) / 2
```

The `Midpoint` function should receive points A and B as parameters and return the midpoint between these two points on a Cartesian plane.

Now, you can implement the `Midpoint` function based on the information provided above. Ensure that the function correctly calculates the midpoint between the two given points.

## Programming Language

The function should be implemented in the C programming language.
