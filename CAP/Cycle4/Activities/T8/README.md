## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C program that allows calculating the altitude reached by an airplane after traveling a certain distance in a straight-line trajectory with a specific takeoff angle. Initially, the airplane forms an angle of 30 degrees with the ground. The goal is to determine the altitude reached by the airplane after traveling a certain distance.

The program should be generic enough to allow the user to input:
- The number of meters traveled by the airplane.
- The takeoff angle (in degrees) with the ground.

The program should calculate the altitude reached by the airplane based on this information and display the result.

Now, you can implement the program based on the information provided above. Make sure the program can receive user inputs and accurately calculate the altitude reached by the airplane.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
