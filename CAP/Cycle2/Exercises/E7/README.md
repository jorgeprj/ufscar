## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and print their condition based on the following table:

| BMI in Adults | Condition          |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Below 18.5    | Underweight        |
| 18.5 to 25    | Normal Weight      |
| 25 to 30      | Overweight         |
| Above 30      | Obese              |

The BMI is calculated using the formula:

```
BMI = weight / (height^2)
```

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the person's weight (in kilograms).
2. Read the person's height (in meters).
3. Calculate the BMI using the provided formula.
4. Determine the person's condition based on the BMI using the table above.
5. Display the result, informing the person's BMI and condition.

## Example

Suppose the person's weight is 70 kilograms, and their height is 1.75 meters. The algorithm should calculate:

```
Weight: 70 kg
Height: 1.75 m
BMI: 22.86
Condition: Normal Weight
```

Therefore, the person's BMI is 22.86, and they have a normal weight.

Now, you can implement the algorithm to calculate the BMI and classify the person's condition based on the provided information. Make sure to read the weight and height, calculate the BMI, determine the condition, and display the result.

## Input Information

The input information for the algorithm should include the person's weight in kilograms and their height in meters.
