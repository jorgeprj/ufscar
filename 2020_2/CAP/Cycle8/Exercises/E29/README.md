## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program that defines a procedure to calculate the area and perimeter of a hexagon.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Implement a procedure called `calculateHexagon` that does not return any values.
2. Inside the procedure, read the side length of the hexagon from the user in the main program.
3. Calculate the area and perimeter of the hexagon based on the provided side length. You can use the `sqrt` and `pow` functions for the necessary mathematical calculations.
4. Display the calculated area and perimeter in the main program.

Ensure that the `calculateHexagon` procedure correctly calculates and displays the area and perimeter of the hexagon based on the provided side length.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following value for the side length of the hexagon:

- Side Length: 5.0

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Hexagon Area: 64.95
Hexagon Perimeter: 30.0
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the calculated area and perimeter of the hexagon based on the provided side length.

Now, you can implement the program with the `calculateHexagon` procedure to calculate and display the area and perimeter of the hexagon.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
