## Question 1 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
float x,p1,y,p2,d;
double t,rad;
double a;

int main(){
     scanf("\n%f",&x);
     scanf("\n%f",&y);
     p1=pow(x,2);
     p2=pow(y,2);
     d=sqrt(p1+p2);
     printf("%5.2f",d);
     a=(-y)/(-x);
     rad=atan(a);
     t=(rad*180)/(3.141592);
     printf("\n%5.2f",t);

     return 0;
}
```

## Question 2 - *Answer*

To solve this question in C, we can follow the steps below:

```c
#include <math.h>
#define PI 3.141592

double x,t1,y;
float d,t;

int main(){
     scanf("\n%f",&d);
     scanf("\n%f",&t);
     t1=t*3.141592/180;
     x=d*cos(t1);
     y=d*sin(t1);
     printf("%5.2f",x);
     printf("\n%5.2f",y);
     
     return 0;
}
```
