## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program that uses a function to calculate the factorial of a given number N.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read an integer value N from the user as input.
2. Implement a function called `calculateFactorial` that receives the integer N as an argument and calculates its factorial.
3. The `calculateFactorial` function should return the factorial of N.
4. Display the calculated factorial to the user.

Ensure that the `calculateFactorial` function correctly calculates the factorial of the provided number.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following value:

- N: 5

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Factorial of 5: 120
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the calculated factorial of the provided number.

Now, you can implement the program with the `calculateFactorial` function to calculate and display the factorial.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
