## Problem Description

In this exercise, you should create an algorithm in VisuAlg that calculates the amount to be paid for a plot of land based on its dimensions (area in square meters) and the price per square meter in the region where the plot of land is located.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the dimensions of the land in square meters.
2. Read the price per square meter in the region.
3. Calculate the total value of the land by multiplying the area by the dimensions by the price per square meter.
4. Display the amount to be paid for the land.

## Example

If the land has dimensions of 10 x 10 meters (100 square meters) and the price per square meter in the region is $202.00, the algorithm should calculate:

```
Land Area: 100 square meters
Price per Square Meter: $202.00
Total Land Value: $20,200.00
```

Therefore, the amount to be paid for the land is $20,200.00.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the information provided above and follow the requested format. Make sure to read the dimensions of the land and the price per square meter in the region, calculate the total value, and display the result to the customer.
