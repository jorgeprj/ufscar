## Problem Description

In this exercise, you will create an algorithm in VisuAlg to read three distinct integer values and display them in descending order.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the first integer value.
2. Read the second integer value.
3. Read the third integer value.
4. Determine and arrange the three integers in descending order.
5. Display the result, showing the integers in descending order.

## Example

Suppose the three integer values are as follows:

- Value 1: 12
- Value 2: 5
- Value 3: 8

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Value 1: 12
Value 2: 8
Value 3: 5
In Descending Order: 12, 8, 5
```

Therefore, the three integers are displayed in descending order.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the provided information and follow the desired format.
