## Problem Description

In this exercise, you should create an algorithm in VisuAlg that reads three grades of a student in a subject and calculates their arithmetic mean.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the student's first grade.
2. Read the student's second grade.
3. Read the student's third grade.
4. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the three grades by adding them together and dividing by 3.
5. Display the result, informing the student's average grade.

## Example

Suppose the student's grades are as follows:

- Grade 1: 7.5
- Grade 2: 8.0
- Grade 3: 6.5

The algorithm should calculate:

```
Grade 1: 7.5
Grade 2: 8.0
Grade 3: 6.5
Student's Average: 7.33
```

Therefore, the student's average grade is 7.33.

Now, you can implement the algorithm based on the provided information and follow the requested format. Make sure to read the three grades of the student, calculate the arithmetic mean, and display the result.
