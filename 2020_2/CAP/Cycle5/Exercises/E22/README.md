## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program to calculate a person's ideal weight based on their height and gender. There are different formulas for calculating the ideal weight for men and women:

```
For Men: Ideal Weight = (72.7 * height) - 58
For Women: Ideal Weight = (62.1 * height) - 44.7
```

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read the person's height (in centimeters) from the user as input.
2. Read the person's gender (either "M" for male or "F" for female) from the user as input.
3. Calculate the ideal weight based on the provided formula for the corresponding gender.
4. Display the calculated ideal weight to the user.

Make sure to implement the formulas correctly based on the provided gender.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following information:

- Height: 175 cm
- Gender: M

The algorithm should calculate and display:

```
Height: 175 cm
Gender: Male
Ideal Weight: 68.25 kg
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about their calculated ideal weight based on their height and gender.

Now, you can implement the program to calculate and display the ideal weight based on the provided information.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
