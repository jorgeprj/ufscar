## Problem Description

In this challenge, you should create a C program that allows calculating the height of a hill based on the information provided by a surveyor. The surveyor initially sees the top of the hill (T) at an angle of 45 degrees. After walking a certain distance towards the hill, they start seeing the top of the hill at a different angle (e.g., 60 degrees). The goal is to determine the height of the hill based on this information.

The program should be generic enough to allow the user to input:
- The number of meters walked towards the hill.
- The initial angle (in degrees) at which the surveyor saw the top of the hill.
- The angle after walking (in degrees) at which the top of the hill is seen.

The program should calculate the height of the hill based on this information and display the result.

Now, you can implement the program based on the information provided above. Make sure the program can receive user inputs and accurately calculate the height of the hill.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
