## Problem Description

In this exercise, you are tasked with creating a C program that reads three different integer values and displays them in descending order.

The algorithm should follow these steps:

1. Read three different integer values from the user as input.
2. Sort the three values in descending order.
3. Display the sorted values in descending order to the user.

Ensure that the algorithm correctly sorts the values in descending order.

## Example

Suppose the user provides the following values:

- Value 1: 14
- Value 2: 7
- Value 3: 22

The algorithm should sort and display the values as follows:

```
Sorted Values in Descending Order: 22, 14, 7
```

Therefore, the algorithm informs the user about the sorted values in descending order.

Now, you can implement the program to read and sort the three values in descending order.

## Programming Language

The program should be implemented in the C programming language.
